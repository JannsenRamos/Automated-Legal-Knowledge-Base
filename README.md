# Automated-Legal-Knowledge-Base
This project automates the structuring of the 2022 DOLE Edition of the Philippine Labor Code. Most RAG systems fail with legal text because they don't account for renumbered articles or repealed provisions. This system uses a Hybrid-AI Router to achieve high-precision extraction with zero API costs.
